# Project Description:
The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation using the K-means algorithm. The dataset contains customer information including customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. Customer segmentation aims to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their similarities and differences in these variables. By clustering customers into meaningful segments, businesses can gain valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, product recommendations, and personalized customer experiences.

# Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to utilize the K-means algorithm to segment customers based on their characteristics, specifically age, annual income, and spending score. The problem can be defined as follows:
Given a dataset with customer information, including customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score, the task is to perform customer segmentation using the K-means algorithm. The algorithm should group customers into clusters based on their similarities in age, annual income, and spending score. The number of clusters should be determined through analysis and experimentation to find an optimal balance between interpretability and meaningful segmentation. The resulting clusters should be analyzed and interpreted to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and potential target segments. Additionally, visualization techniques should be employed to effectively present the segmented clusters and their characteristics.

# The project deliverables include the following:
Data preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset, and perform any necessary data transformations or feature engineering.
K-means clustering: Implement the K-means algorithm to cluster customers based on age, annual income, and spending score.
Cluster analysis: Analyze the resulting clusters to understand the characteristics and differences among customer segments.
Visualization: Create visualizations to present the segmented clusters and their properties, enabling clear and intuitive interpretation of the customer segments.
Insights and recommendations: Derive meaningful insights from the customer segments and provide actionable recommendations for marketing strategies, product development, or personalized customer experiences.
